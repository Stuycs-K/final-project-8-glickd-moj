## Overview
Recreation of the game Blackjack. We will make a deck of 52 cards that can be shuffled and dealt. Then, users will be able to play blackjack against a computer. The UI will allow users to press on screen buttons to make their decisions. There will also be a chip class which allows users to bet (until they go broke) and try to make money from our program.
## Instructions
Once the program starts, select the amount you want to bet. Then, click bet to confirm the bet. Once you see your hand, chose to hit until you eventually decide to stand (or bust). Then, the dealer will take their turn. A winner will be announced and you will have the option to play again by clicking "New hand" or "New game" if you've gone totally broke.

### Dev Log
Hit, stand, and new hand all work. Logically the game mechanics are sound.
It is still a litlte bug-gy when it comes to the processing mechanics of the game. Including buttons. 
Button library, card images
